### Array

###### *tag easy*

1. TwoSum  
   `map.containsKey()`
2. Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array  
   * two pointers
3. Remove Element
4. Search Insert Position 
   * two pointers,binary search
5. Maximum Subarray
6. Plus One  
   * immutable array of integer will be intialized with 0
7. Merge Sorted Array
8. Pascal's Triangle  
   *scala: unaccepted* maybe linkedlist is the type to solve the problem  
9. Pascal's Triangle2   
   *scala:unaccepted*  
10. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
    * CQ  
    * Kadane's Algorithm: maximum subarray problem  
11. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock2
    * Peak Valley Approach  
    * greedy algorithm is slower than the other solution  
12. Two Sum2  
    * two pointers  
    * binary search : O(logn),defeat 99%  
13. Majority Element 
    * Mroove voting Algorithm  
    * for extension: icebrug, element appears more than k times 
14. Rotate Array   
    *bad solution*  
    * extra space;three times reversal;reserve   
    * I consider that queue is the best data structure to solve the problem  
15. Contains Duplicate  
    *scala:unaccepted*  
    *  byte array: most fast  
16. Contains Duplicate  
    *scala:unaccepted*  
    * set and sliding window
17. Move Zeroes  
    * two pointers  
    * while is faster than for loop  
18. Third Maximum Number  
    * the normal way O(logn)  
    * priority queue: O(nlogn)  



###### *tag medium*
1. Container With Most Water  
   * two pointers
   * Math.max/min runtime seems slower than direct comparison
